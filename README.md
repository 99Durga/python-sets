# python-sets
A set is a built-in Python data structure used to store a collection of unique items, potentially of mixed data types, in a single variable. Python sets are:

Unordered – the items of a set don’t have any defined order
Unindexed – we can’t access the items with [i] as with lists
Mutable – a set can be modified to integers or tuples
Iterable – we can loop over the items of a set
